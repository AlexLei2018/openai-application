        "- Understand the Task: Grasp the main objective, goals, requirements, constraints, and expected output.\n",
        "- Minimal Changes: If an existing prompt is provided, improve it only if it's simple. For complex prompts, enhance clarity and add missing elements without altering the original structure.\n",
        "- Reasoning Before Conclusions**: Encourage reasoning steps before any conclusions are reached. ATTENTION! If the user provides examples where the reasoning happens afterward, REVERSE the order! NEVER START EXAMPLES WITH CONCLUSIONS!\n",
        "    - Reasoning Order: Call out reasoning portions of the prompt and conclusion parts (specific fields by name). For each, determine the ORDER in which this is done, and whether it needs to be reversed.\n",
        "    - Conclusion, classifications, or results should ALWAYS appear last.\n",
        "- Examples: Include high-quality examples if helpful, using placeholders [in brackets] for complex elements.\n",
        "   - What kinds of examples may need to be included, how many, and whether they are complex enough to benefit from placeholders.\n",
        "- Clarity and Conciseness: Use clear, specific language. Avoid unnecessary instructions or bland statements.\n",
        "- Formatting: Use markdown features for readability. DO NOT USE ``` CODE BLOCKS UNLESS SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED.\n",
        "- Preserve User Content: If the input task or prompt includes extensive guidelines or examples, preserve them entirely, or as closely as possible. If they are vague, consider breaking down into sub-steps. Keep any details, guidelines, examples, variables, or placeholders provided by the user.\n",
        "- Constants: DO include constants in the prompt, as they are not susceptible to prompt injection. Such as guides, rubrics, and examples.\n",
        "- Output Format: Explicitly the most appropriate output format, in detail. This should include length and syntax (e.g. short sentence, paragraph, JSON, etc.)\n",
        "    - For tasks outputting well-defined or structured data (classification, JSON, etc.) bias toward outputting a JSON.\n",

This substantial increase suggests a strong demand for the company’s products or services despite macroeconomic conditions.\n- Vehicle margin improved significantly by 600 basis points YoY and 300 basis points QoQ to 12.2%. This enhancement indicates better cost management or changes in product mix, contributing to healthier profit margins.\n- Total revenues nearly doubled YoY (98.9%) and rose 76.1% QoQ, highlighting that the company capitalized on its sales surge effectively.\n- Gross profit skyrocketed by 1,841% YoY from a low base in the previous year, achieving a gross margin of 9.7%, which is up by 870 basis points YoY. These metrics reflect a remarkable improvement in production or supply chain efficiencies leading to greater profitability.\n\n**Liquidity and Solvency Analysis:**\n- The report does not provide sufficient data to perform a detailed liquidity analysis or specify liquidity ratios such as the current or quick ratios, but given the significant loss figures, the firm's ability to cover short-term obligations should be examined further.\n- Net loss reduction of 16.7% YoY and 2.7% QoQ suggests operational efficiencies have improved, reducing the burden on the company’s financial resources. \n\n**Efficiency Analysis:**\n- While specific efficiency ratios like inventory turnover are not available, the significant growth in sales and gross profit implies that the company might be improving its operational efficiency or benefiting from economies of scale.\n  \n**Key Insights:**\n- The narrowing adjusted loss from operations and net loss underscores improved cost management and operational efficiencies.\n- Despite ongoing losses, which could threaten long-term viability, the company’s increased revenue and gross profit reflect a strengthening market position.\n- Continuous improvement in margins and a reduction of losses in successive quarters indicate potential financial stabilization.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Focus on sustaining and enhancing sales growth by exploring new markets or reinforcing existing distribution networks. \n- Leverage improved vehicle margins by analyzing further cost-cutting measures without compromising quality, to eventually reach profitability.\n- Maintain close monitoring of expenses against revenue growth to ensure operational efficiencies continue to improve.\n- Explore options for debt restructuring if high indebtedness poses significant risks to liquidity, ensuring the company remains solvent through its growth phase.\n- Further develop non-GAAP adjusted financial reporting to transparently communicate financial stabilization efforts to investors, which could positively influence stock market perception and value.\n\nThe company's strategic focus should aim at carefully balancing growth with a keen eye on cost control and liquidity management, while exploring avenues for new capital to support further expansion."

This comment hints at a poignant moment between the two former teammates.\n\n## Szczesny's Sudden Shift to Barcelona\n\nWojciech Szczesny decided to retire this past summer after it became apparent Juventus was planning a future without him. His retirement, however, was short-lived. In a surprising turn of events, he joined Barcelona as an emergency substitute for Marc-Andre ter Stegen once he ended his spell on the sidelines.\n\n## Ronaldo and Szczesny's Reunion\n\nRonaldo, while on duty with Portugal in Szczesny’s home of Poland, took the opportunity to reunite with his former teammate. The Polish Football Federation captured footage of their lighthearted interaction, where Ronaldo cheekily congratulated Szczesny on his move. \"You needed to retire to go to a big club,\" Ronaldo quipped, seemingly poking fun at Juventus in the process.\n\n## Ronaldo's Juventus Legacy\n\nDespite Ronaldo's warm send-off of Juventus as an \"amazing club\" when he transferred to Manchester United in 2021, his time in Turin remains a matter of debate. During his tenure, Ronaldo amassed an impressive 101 goals over 134 matches and secured two Serie A titles in three seasons. Yet, questions linger about whether his presence truly elevated the team.\n\n## Legal Entanglements with Juventus\n\nIn more serious news, Ronaldo has been embroiled in a legal dispute with Juventus earlier this year concerning unpaid wages due to deferrals during the COVID-19 pandemic. A court ruled in Ronaldo's favor, determining the club owed him a substantial €10 million.\n\nThis blend of humorous exchanges and legal disputes paints a complex picture of Ronaldo’s relationship with his former club, reflecting both camaraderie and challenges navigated beyond the pitch."

Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the development plan, outlining key technologies and detailed implementations using Python for back-end functionalities along with front-end considerations.\n\n### Part 1: Front-end Development (Client Functions)\n\n#### Technologies:\n- **Vite**: A build tool for faster front-end development.\n- **Vue3**: JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.\n- **TypeScript**: For type safety in the front-end code.\n- **Redux**: For state management.\n\n#### Features and Implementations:\n\n1. **User Registration and Login**:\n   - **Register.vue**: Form with fields for email, password, and confirmation code. Validates user input and sends registration data to the server.\n   - **Login.vue**: Allows user login using registered credentials. Integrates Redux for maintaining user state.\n\n   ```vue\n   <!-- Example of Register.vue -->\n   <template>\n     <div>\n       <form @submit.prevent=\"registerUser\">\n         <input v-model=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email\" type=\"email\" required />\n         <input v-model=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\" type=\"password\" required />\n         <input v-model=\"confirmationCode\" placeholder=\"Confirmation Code\" required />\n         <button type=\"submit\">Register</button>\n       </form>\n     </div>\n   </template>\n\n   <script lang=\"ts\">\n   import { defineComponent, ref } from 'vue';\n\n   export default defineComponent({\n     setup() {\n       const email = ref('');\n       const password = ref('');\n       const confirmationCode = ref('');\n\n       const registerUser = () => {\n         // Call API to register user\n       };\n\n       return { email, password, confirmationCode, registerUser };\n     }\n   });\n   </script>\n   ```\n\n2. **Product Browsing**:\n   - Implement components for product listing, search functionality, and detailed product view including filtering and sorting.\n\n3. **Shopping Cart**:\n   - Component for adding/removing products and modifying quantities. Utilize Redux to synchronize cart state.\n\n4. **Order Management**:\n   - Implement order confirmation and order history pages. Handle state with Redux.\n\n5. **Personal Account Management**:\n   - Components for viewing/editing user information and accessing payment records.\n\n6. **Notification Function**:\n   - Integration of WebSocket or similar technology for real-time updates on orders and promotions.\n\n### Part 2: Back-end Development (Merchant Functions)\n\n#### Technologies:\n- **Python**: Using a framework like Flask or Django for REST API development.\n- **MySQL**: For database management.\n\n#### Features and Implementations:\n\n1. **Product Management**:\n   - Develop RESTful APIs to add, edit, delete products, and manage inventory.\n\n   ```python\n   # Using Flask for example\n   from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n   from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n   app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'mysql+pymysql://username:password@localhost/db_name'\n   db = SQLAlchemy(app)\n\n   class Product(db.Model):\n       id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n       name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)\n       description = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)\n       price = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=False)\n       inventory_count = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False)\n\n   @app.route('/api/products', methods=['POST'])\n   def add_product():\n       data = request.json\n       new_product = Product(\n           name=data['name'],\n           description=data['description'],\n           price=data['price'],\n           inventory_count=data['inventory_count']\n       )\n       db.session.add(new_product)\n       db.session.commit()\n       return jsonify({\"message\": \"Product added successfully\"}), 201\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       app.run(debug=True)\n   ```\n\n2. **Order Management**:\n   - Create APIs to view and update orders. Integrate a notification system to inform users of order status.\n\n3. **User Management**:\n   - Provide APIs for customer data insights and support management.\n\n4. **Data Analysis**:\n   - Generate sales reports and user behavior analytics with Python libraries like Pandas.\n\n5. **Settings and Configuration**:\n   - APIs for application settings, delivery options, and data management.\n\n### Part 3: Database Linkage\n\n- **MySQL Setup**:\n  - Create necessary tables for users, products, orders, etc.\n  - Use SQLAlchemy or another ORM to facilitate database operations in Python effectively.\n\n### Part 4: Payment Function\n\n- Integrate payments using known services, securing API keys, and ensuring secure data handling.\n\n### Security and Scalability Considerations\n\n- **Security**: Employ JWT for authentication, ensure encrypted communication via HTTPS, and implement CSRF protection.\n- **Scalability**: Use load balancing and possibly containerization (Docker) for handling increased traffic. Design a modular back-end to accommodate new features easily.\n\nThis structured plan provides a robust starting point for a mobile commerce platform tailored to individual merchants' needs. Each function should be rigorously tested, especially the payment system, to ensure data security and system reliability."
